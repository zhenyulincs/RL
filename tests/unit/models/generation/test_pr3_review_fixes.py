"""Structural unit tests for the rlix-task2 selective-sync review fixes.

Three independent fixes; each is a CORRECTNESS issue that surfaces only
under TP>1 / multi-receiver topology. Tests here are mock-only — no
Ray, no GPUs — so they run in CI alongside the existing fast suite.

Behavioral verification of the deadlock path (Bug 1) requires real
Ray-actor scheduling under NCCL and is left to upstream multi-GPU
selective-sync integration tests; the lexical guard at the bottom of
this file catches obvious source-level regressions in the meantime.
